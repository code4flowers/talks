# Kanban for Everything - Managing Software Projects to Binging Netflix

Presented at Day of Agile and Cincy.Develop() - _July 28, 2017_

## Abstract

Between home, family and work, I often feel like I’m too busy to get everything done. I’ve been using Kanban with great
success at work, but until talking with my friend, Patrick, I’d never thought about applying this technique outside
software. Over the last year, Patrick has more than doubled his media consumption by using a Kanban board to manage
what he reads and watches. His story inspired me to bring Kanban into more aspects of my own life, and it’s taught me
just how flexible Kanban really is.

In this talk, I will go over the basics of using Kanban before diving into several real-life
examples of Kanban boards for managing all types of projects using Trello. From organizing tasks at home to managing a
software project, we will explore how to improve workflows and get things done. And, of course, we will take a look at
Patrick's Netflix board that started it all.
